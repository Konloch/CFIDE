### What is this repository for? ###

* Analysing, editing and reverse engineering compiled Java classes with a UI.
* To prove my manhood, save code online, promote free code (currently being rewritten and improved upon).

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Pull from GitHub to Eclipse or something (EGit).
2. Make sure library jars are added, 1.7+ compiler compliance set and src/resource folders are setup correctly.
